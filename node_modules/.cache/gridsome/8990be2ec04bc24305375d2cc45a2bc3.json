For this small project backed by my student budget, I only tested one user instead of the recommended three users (sorry Mr. Krug). With unlimited resources, I would have done a more thorough Do-It-Yourself Usability testing.\n\nThis short test opened my eyes to the importance of user testing. As someone who design and code websites, I could not imagine not testing my site.\"\n            />\n          </div>\n        </section>\n\n        <!-- CREDITS -->\n        <section>\n          <section-credits\n            body=\"Pablo Stanley \nHumaaans design library\n\nSteve Krug\nUser testing template from Rocket Surgery Made Easy\n\"\n          />\n          <div class=\"italic mt-24 text-center\">Thank you for visiting my project!</div>\n        </section>\n      </article>\n\n      <!-- NEXT PROJECT -->\n      <div class=\"nextproject\">\n        <div class=\"container\">\n          <h2 class=\"text-center mb-5\">More Projects</h2>\n          <div class=\"flex flex-col items-center\">\n            <div class=\"justify-center align-middle\">\n              <proj-card-toyo />\n              <proj-card-companion  class=\"mt-5\" />  \n                <proj-card-portfolio class=\"mt-5\"/>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </main>\n  </Project>\n",null]}
